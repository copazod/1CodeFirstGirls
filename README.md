# 1CodeFirstGirls

This is my 1st git repository!

Code First Girls wants to help more women break into and excel within the tech industry. 

I got accepted in 'Introduction to Python & App'. A course of 8 weeks where we went from the basics to APIs.

In this repository you can find my homework, extra exercises and the last project to finish the course.
